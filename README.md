# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 
###### Jill asked me to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. The LendingClub dataset will be used for various mechine learning credit risk models and their performance will be evealuated.  

# Results: 
###### Using bulleted lists, describe the 
- balanced accuracy scores and 
- the precision and 
- recall scores of all six machine learning models. 
![](http) Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: 
###### Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
